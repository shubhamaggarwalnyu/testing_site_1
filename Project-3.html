                <h2> Problem </h2>
                <br>
                <p> According to CDC (2017), 1 in 68 children under the age of 8 are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder in the United States.  Symptoms of autism include social development problems, lack of communication skills, and general sensory issues. To address these problems, most treatment plans implement some form of behavior modification, which aims to change performance through the use of a reward system. While these approaches are popular, there is a clear need to develop more intrinsically-motivated tools for students with autism to express themselves.
                  <br>
                  <br>
 
                In recent years, research  has shown that one effective alternative to improving the social and communicative development of autistic learners is through art therapy (Evans & Dubowski, 2001). Since many autistic learners struggle with emotional development, art therapy provides the tools and framework for learners to communicate their emotions in ways other than words and speech. 
                <br>
                <br>

                An additional gap in therapy techniques for autistic learners is the method of instruction. In 2009, the University of North Carolina conducted a series of studies that showed how students with autism learn better under structured conditions. From this research, the authors developed a new evidence-based approach to teaching called the TEACCH approach, which proposed four essential mechanisms for instruction for kids with autism, including:
                <br>
                1. Structuring the environment and activities in ways that are understandable to the individual.
                <br>
                2. Using individuals’ relative strengths in visual skills and interest in visual details to supplement relatively weaker skills.
                <br>
                3. Using individuals’ special interests to engage them in learning.
                <br>
                4.Supporting self-initiated use of meaningful communication.

                
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  <h2> Solution </h2>
                  <br>
                <b>"Teach by  Touch"</b> combines  the mechanisms  for structured  instruction with  art therapy in  order to  improve the ability of  autistic  children  to  express their ideas creatively. In other words, it is  an  art therapy experience  for autism  spectrum  learners  who wish  to  have  a more  intuitive 
                experience  painting  on  canvas. In  a single  session,  users can learn to  express themselves  and explore the use of  color in  painting  through interactions  with  an  Arduino-supported learning  environment.

                <!--please add bullets-->
                <p> Autistic  learners

                    Children  ages  5+

                    Novice  art students  (little/no  prior painting  experience)

                    Learners  that  have  access  to  computer  and Arduino

                    All racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups

                    All genders (although autism  is  4.5 times more  common  among boys)
                  </p>

<br>
<h2> Learning Goals </h2>
                <br>
                <!--please add bullets-->
                <ul>
                <p> 
                  <li> The general learning  goals of  Teach By  Touch do  not directly  address Common  Core  curriculum. Rather, the goals support development in  communication,  creativity, and critical  thinking—skills that  are necessary to  succeed in  math, science,  and language  arts. </li>

                <li>Learners  will  be  able  to  express themselves  through creative  means.</li>

                <li>Learners  will  be  able  to  evaluate  how colors  translate into  the real  world.</li>

                <li>Learners  will  gradually learn how to  paint features  on  their own through scaffolded  learning.</li>

                <li>Learners  will  feel  a sense of  accomplishments by  tracking  their progress; they  will  hang  up  their 
                artwork,  in  order of  difficulty  level of  the painting.</li>

                </p>
                </ul>
<br>

<h2> Product Demonstration </h2>
                <br>
                <p> By disengaging autistic learners from screen-learning and instead applying a combination of traditional painting and embodied cognition to the artistic process, Teach By Touch aims to improve learners’ ability to express themselves. In other words, learners will be able to “think through action”.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                As outlined in the storyboard above, learners will use Teach By Touch to teach themselves how to paint through a scaffolded process, supported by Arduino—a programmable circuit board connected to a laptop or computer. In addition to the Arduino board, the Teach By Touch kit will come with a box containing the following materials:
                <br>
                ●   6 medium roll up canvases, each with a different “coloring book” style visual printed on it
                <br>
                ●   An easel
                <br>
                ●   Crayola Tempera non-toxic, conductive paint set (6 colors, water-heavy)
                <br>
                ●   6 special bowls that connect to the Arduino board
                <br>
                Using these materials, the learner will set up the lesson by pouring the paint in the bowls and attaching the level 1 canvas to the easel. The user will follow specific directions to set up the Arduino kit so that all sensors are attached to their corresponding bowls.
                <br>
                <br>


               The following <b>storyboards </b> depict a snapshot of the user experience for the product:

                <!--add image Picture 1--image should be large enough & clearly visible-->

                <img src="img/3P/Picture1.png">
              </div>

<br>
<br>

                During our experimentation with Arduino, we weren’t able to fully establish a connection between the circuit in Arduino and paint which could be because the paint wasn’t watery enough for the charge to flow. This is more of “Wizard-of-Ozed” prototype of our concept design.
                <br>
