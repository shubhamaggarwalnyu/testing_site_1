                <h2> Problem </h2>
                <br>
                <p> The term ‘learning disabilities’ refers to a group of disorders characterized by difficulties in several academic abilities (e.g. speaking, reading, writing or working with numbers). It has been stated that 3.5% of the students suffer from reading problems and Dyslexia, by far, is one of the most common learning disabilities (Bjšrklund, 2011). Students  with  dyslexia  have  severe  difficulty  in  reading,  spellings and language  which makes it  difficult  for them  to  cope  with  the standard  curriculum  followed  in  classrooms. Due to  this  they  commit  errors  in  written and oral  expression (Abasa & Zamanb, 2009).
                  <br>
                  <br>
                A study by Obradovic et al. (2015) suggested that dyslexic students can be benefited from “creative interactive activities, visual presentations, project-based learning, school experiments, which are based on student engagement and activities”. 
                <br>
                <br>
                AR systems/applications  enable  users to  sense properties  about the real  world,  process in  real  time, use visual, audio,  and haptic  means overlaid  on  the real  world and the use of  mobile  or  wearable  devices (Roesner, et al., 2014). Its capability to  combine the real  world with  virtual content presents   new possibilities for learning that  could be proved extremely beneficial for students  with  learning disabilities (Karamanoli & Tsinakos, 2015).
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  <h2> Solution </h2>
                  <br>
                Inspired by these researches and by my own personal experiences of working with dyslexic children in the past, I decided to create  <b>"ReadAlive"</b> which uses the affordances of AR to help children establish the <b>grapheme-phoneme correspondence</b>, that is, the letter-sound connection. The use of AR enables the letters to come “alive” along with its associated sound. The app will also allow the child to practice letter formation and object recognition in the AR environment. These features can be directly mapped on the skill deficits and challenges faced by children with Dyslexia.

 <h2> Target Audience </h2>
              
                <!--please add bullets-->
                <ul>
                <p> 
                  <li> Children who have been diagnosed with learning disabilities specially Dyslexia. </li>
                  
                  <li> Children in the age range of 3-6 years will benefit the most out of the product. But children more than 6 years old who have issues with letter-sound connection can also use this app. </li>
                  
                  <li> The app can only be used to learn English alphabets and is currently not supporting other languages. </li>

                  <li> It can be used for students in schools as well as by parents and caregivers at home. </li>
                  </p>
                </ul>

<h2> Learning Goals </h2>
           
                <!--please add bullets-->
                <ul>
                <p> 
                  <li>Learn the alphabets and their associated sounds (grapheme-phoneme correspondence)</li>
                    
                   <li> Visualize words with images for better retention in the long-term</li>
                    
                    <li>Practice letter formation by understanding its particular sound</li>
                    
                    <li>Explore the environment to find objects starting with the particular letter.</li>

                  </p>
                </ul>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Product Demonstration </h2>
                <br>
                <p> Children with Dyslexia have also been found to commit errors in writing because they tend to write ‘b’ instead of ‘d’ or ‘p’ instead of ‘q’ and vice versa. It generally happens due to the deficit in letter-sound connection due to which they get confused between the letter formation. Through the app, the child will be able to practice letter formation along with the sound associated with it.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                The affordance of the AR technology used in the app will be that the child can explore the surrounding environment to spot things and objects starting with that particular letter. For example, finding objects starting with the letter ‘a’ such as apple, arm, etc. Visualizing images associated with that letter will help them retain that information for a longer period of time.
                <br>
                <br>

                The following <b>storyboards</b> depict a snapshot of the user experience for the product:

                <!--add image Soryboard 1 & 2--images should be large enough & clearly visible-->

                <img src="img/2P/Storyboard 1.png">
                <br>
                <img src="img/2P/Stroyboard 2.png">
                <br>
              </div>

<br>
<br>

                Please follow these steps to view the <b> digital prototype</b> of AR experience:

                <br>
<br>
1.  Download the Zappar app on your mobile phone.
<br>
2.  Download the image from the Google Drive folder (link here). <!--add google drive folder link-->
<br>
3.  Scan the ZapCode from the mobile device.
<br>
4.  The letter will pop up in the AR environment. Click on the sound icon to hear the sound associated with the letter.
<br>
<br>


To make this experience more engaging, parents can work together with their kids to construct a story around the objects that the child recognizes for one letter. By tapping into their potential of creativity and using this strategy, it will provide a context for the child to remember and retain this information. An interactive learning environment & appropriate reinforcement can go a long way in encouraging the learner to go go above and beyond their abilities.
