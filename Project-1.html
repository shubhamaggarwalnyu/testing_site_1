								According to the report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in May 2013, 1 in 5 children suffer from a mental disorder in a given year across the United States. This implies that approximately 17 million young people meet the criteria for mental disorders which impedes their abilities to learn, behave, and express their emotions.

								Usually, first signs of mental illnesses are shown by a person before the age of 14 years and
								unfortunately, only less than 20% of children and adolescents receive timely interventions
								(Kessler et al., 2007).

								The 2015 Children’s Mental Health Report by the Child Mind Institute also suggested that
								giving children access to mental-health resources early in their education plays a critical role in

							The current school educational system places a lot of emphasis on awareness about physical health and hygiene but not as much on mental health and resilience. The future generation has to be raised in a way that makes them more cognizant of their mental health and the role it plays in leading a healthy, balanced life. This responsibility lies in the hands of many stakeholders such as schools, teachers, parents, and counselors.
						 
							There are different ways and resources that could be used to encourage children to work towards
							their mental fitness. For example, deep breathing, relaxation exercises, mindfulness meditation,
							and yoga are some of the commonly used practices by people to train their minds to become strong and resilient in the face of adversities. They are highly beneficial and can have a lasting positive impact on the overall well-being (Cherkin, Sherman & Balderson, 2016; Woodyard, 2011).
							 
							As a School Psychologist & Behavioral Trainer, I used these methods very frequently with children of different age groups with an aim that having learned all these skills, they will be able to better understand themselves at an emotional and psychological level. But I observed that most of the time, children (especially, in the age range of 5-12 years) find it difficult to establish a connection with these practices because they find them ‘less engaging’ or ‘boring’.

						Anxiety is one of the most commonly occurring mental health issues among children (Verhulst,
						1997).  The 2015 Children’s Mental Health Report by the Child Mind Institute revealed that approximately 31.9% of children have been diagnosed with anxiety-related issues.  According to the National Institute of Health, around 25% of young children frequently experience symptoms of anxiety but if they have developed strategies and skills to cope with such situations, then they are most likely able to successfully handle them effectively.
						 
						Researches in the field of child development have shown that the learning experiences encountered in the earliest years (age of 5 to 12 years) have a significant impact on shaping their young brains (Huttenlocher & Dabholkar, 1997).
						 
						The CBT approach has been found to be one of the most widely used interventions
						for anxiety-related issues (Butler, et.al., 2006; Smits & Hofmann, 2008).  Research has consistently shown that creative, play-based activities, presented within the context of an empathically attuned therapeutic relationship, engage children and enhance the effectiveness of CBT (Knell & Dasari, 2011; Lowenstein, 2016; Podell et al., 2009; Shelby & Berk, 2009).

						The Crumpled Paper Throw game (Lowenstein, 2016) is an active and engaging game focused on psychoeducation of anxiety, its associated physiological responses, and the process of CBT. This helps to maintain children’s interest and helps them to absorb the material. But apart from information, it doesn’t give an opportunity to learn skills and strategies effectively handle anxiety-provoking situations.

						But presently, there aren’t any resources that are designed in a way that a child can consume and understand such a complex and nuanced area of mental health such as anxiety. Thus, the biggest challenge here is to create a comprehensive resource that is engaging enough for the kids themselves. Along with it being a knowledge storehouse, it should also have a plethora of various resources and tools to work towards mental fitness.

				       	In order to make it a meaningful and relevant learning experience, it was important to design something which is creative, innovative and most importantly, very engaging for the target audience (age 5-7-year old children). This is the underlying reason for having an interactive digital game-based component of the solution. As the main focus was on creating a fun yet meaningful ‘learning’ experience, it was crucial to have facilitators who can ensure that the process of learning takes place effectively. Going through multiple cycles of iterations with sketches & low-fi wireframes, I realized that there has to be a streamlined framework that can standardize the whole learning experience as well as provide guidelines to facilitators to ensure the goals and objectives are achieved appropriately. Therefore, the resulting solution is a website that serves as a resource hub for various toolkits consisting of interactive tools and digital games that can be played on a touchscreen-based smartphone or tablet. Moreover, it also has an additional component – the guided reflection process in order to ensure effective learning and transfer of skills to real-life experiences takes place.

				       	Children in the age range of 5-10 years are in the stage of incredible intellectual growth. This period is called by psychologists as the ‘age of reason’ as the child starts developing the skills for complex thinking and comprehension of abstract situations (Piaget, 1936). Keeping in mind the developmental levels, there is a high probability that if children are educated about physical and mental health issues during this crucial period, then it will stay with them throughout their lives.

				       	Monkey-Mind is a creative, action-oriented, web and mobile-based platform designed to educate children about mental health using interactive multimedia technology resources and digital games. It comprises of different toolkits focused on various facets of mental health such as anxiety, depression, aggression, etc. Every toolkit follows a three-tier process approach designed to be facilitated by a parent, teacher or counselor: Learn about the topic, Play the game and Reflect on learning. The treatment approaches for different types of anxiety-related issues varies depending on its sources, causes, and severity of impairment. It requires an expert with specialized training to design an individual-specific treatment plan. Therefore, at the moment, the project is not focused on creating or implementing a treatment plan for severe anxiety disorders. The main premise and the underlying foundation of this design project is two-fold: i. to create a platform for educating every child about different aspects of mental health; and ii. to learn and practice skills for coping with challenging and stressful situations in a fun and interactive manner. However, the therapists and counselors can use this platform at their discretion as a complimentary resource with their individualized treatment plans for children with severe anxiety problems.

				       	 Amy is a 6-year-old girl who tends to get extremely anxious and worried about trivial things. This has a deleterious impact on her interpersonal relationships with friends and family as well as her performance in academics and extra-curricular activities. Her teachers find it challenging to deal with Amy’s mood swings and aggression. Moreover, her anxiety tends to go off-hand during highly stressful and demanding situations such as a school exam, sports competition, or poem recital events. Her nervousness and anxiety lead to low self-esteem and confidence which further increases her anxiety leading to being trapped in a vicious cycle.
